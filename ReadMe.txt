A tool from the year 2000 era, it was intended to let people (me) experiment with different dithering types. The mobile devices of the era had design constraints and quirky palette requirements.and I needed a tool.  Anyway this is that tool, a tool to solve my dithering needs for early mobile phone games.

I found the source sitting in an old folder and I thought I would see if it would still compile, that was a big nope.  Several weeks later, a few frustrating days and many distractions here it is all its quirks, warts, bugs and utility.  

Plus a couple new things I wanted to combine into one place so it is really a mess of different tools but nothing cohesive, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

So how to use it?  Fairly self explanatory DitherStudio a tool dither things, you can paste your perfectly good 24 rgb artwork and get out a much lower quality but hopefully with acceptably less banding, and shown in all the horror that is banding with a swap between modes.
