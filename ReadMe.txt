My utility from the early 2000s for comparing limited colorspaces. I got it compiling again in Visual Studio 2019, here it is with all its quirks, warts, bugs and some usefulness.  I use it a lot as a viewing tool, in addition to viewing images it also supports opening binary files via drag and drop.  It sports a few oddball image processing functions, inversion, flipping, splitting and some other useful things.

The Project uses vcpkg and has the following dependencies.

glm
boost
angle

--BPT
